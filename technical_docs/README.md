## Jisc
_simply transcribed from the wordpress site_  

The Learning Records Warehouse, which stores activity data in xAPI and student data in a standard format known as the Universal Data Definitions (UDD). This is based on the HT2 Learning Locker open source product augmented to support Jisc UDD storage.

A sample data set including student data, VLE, attendance, and library use as well as sample predictions.  Whilst the data will be generated, it will follow a similar profile to the live data set.

Analytics Labs – a secure desktop environment, allowing creation of visualizations using Tableau.

Jisc’s Universal xAPI Translator, which allows data to be rapidly converted from text files into any xAPI profile, allowing easy testing of new recipes and profiles.

Sample xAPI aggregation code toolkit, showing how to aggregate xAPI and UDD data as the first step in producing visualizations.

Access to the API and code for the Jisc student app – Study Goal, allowing experimentation with student facing services.

## Tribal Student Insight
